# Final project for Systems Analysis and Decision Support Methods course.

It covers issues related to Machine Learning, such as collecting and scraping data from various sources, data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualization of multi-dimensional data, model training and predictions.
The topic of the project is to predict countries' GDP per capita based on finding correlation between GDP per capita and various educational, geographical and population factors.
Data used for the project:
 - GDP per capita
 - percentage of GDP spent on education
 - population
 - percentage of the population with tertiary education
 - top 1000 universities in the world

There were 5 models trained to solve the problem (after data gathering, preprocessing and EDA):
 - Linear Regression
 - Support Vector Machine (SVR)
 - Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

The process of data preparation and analysis, model training and drawing conclusions is precisely described in MSiD_Project.pdf file in this repository (in Polish).
